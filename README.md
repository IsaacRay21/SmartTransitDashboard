# Smart Transit Dashboard

## Overview
The Smart Transit Dashboard is a web application designed to provide real-time public transit updates, predict delays based on machine learning, and offer smart route suggestions. The goal is to enhance public transportation in Minnesota, where buses often experience delays, especially in extreme weather conditions. The application will incorporate various technologies, including real-time APIs, machine learning for predictive analysis, and an intuitive user interface.

## Features
- **Real-time Transit Updates**: Fetch live transit data from Google Transit API.
- **Delay Prediction with Machine Learning**: Utilize weather, time, and historical data to estimate transit delays.
- **Route Optimization**: Suggest the best routes based on real-time data and machine learning insights.
- **User Alerts & Notifications**: Notify users of delays, cancellations, and alternative routes.
- **Interactive Map Interface**: Display transit routes and vehicle locations dynamically.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React.js, Tailwind CSS, Leaflet.js (for maps)
- **State Management**: React Context API or Redux
- **Backend**: Firebase (Firestore for database, Functions for serverless API)
- **Machine Learning**: Python (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow), Flask API for ML integration
- **APIs**: Google Transit API, OpenWeather API
- **Deployment**: Vercel, Firebase Hosting

## Weekly Development Goals

### Week 1: Project Setup & Research
- Set up the GitHub repository and initialize project structure.
- Research and evaluate the APIs (Google Transit API, OpenWeather API) to understand their capabilities and limitations.
- Define the project scope, finalize core features, and create a rough UI wireframe.

### Week 2: Frontend Development (React Setup)
- Set up a React project using Vite or Create React App.
- Install and configure Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Implement basic routing with React Router.
- Create UI components such as search bar, navigation, and route selection.

### Week 3: Integrating APIs & Data Fetching
- Fetch real-time transit data using Google Transit API.
- Store and manage fetched data using React Context API or Redux.
- Display transit data in a structured and user-friendly way.
- Implement basic error handling for API failures.

### Week 4: Map & Data Visualization
- Integrate Leaflet.js to display an interactive transit map.
- Plot transit routes and vehicle locations dynamically on the map.
- Implement filters and overlays to allow users to customize their views.

### Week 5: Machine Learning Integration (Basic Model)
- Gather and preprocess transit and weather data for model training.
- Develop a basic machine learning model using Scikit-learn to predict delays.
- Set up a Flask API to serve ML model predictions to the frontend.
- Implement API calls in React to retrieve and display predictions.

### Week 6: Enhancing ML Model & User Features
- Improve the ML model by incorporating additional factors such as time of day, historical trends, and traffic conditions.
- Implement user authentication with Firebase Authentication.
- Develop a notification system to alert users of delays, cancellations, or alternative routes.

### Week 7: Testing & Optimization
- Conduct end-to-end testing of the React frontend.
- Optimize API calls and state management to improve performance.
- Address UI/UX feedback, ensuring the application is intuitive and user-friendly.
- Fix any bugs and refine the transit prediction accuracy.

### Week 8: Deployment & Documentation
- Deploy the application using Vercel or Firebase Hosting.
- Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment and updates.
- Write detailed documentation, including API usage, setup instructions, and troubleshooting guides.
- Finalize the README with installation steps and usage examples.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement reinforcement learning to further optimize route suggestions.
- Introduce crowdsourced user reports for real-time transit updates.
- Expand coverage to multiple cities beyond Minnesota.
